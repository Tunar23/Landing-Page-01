                <h3>Goldtop (1952-1958)</h3> <br>
                <p>The first Les Paul model Goldtops were produced from 1952 to 1957. Early 1952 Les Pauls were not
                    issued serial numbers, did not have bound fingerboards, and are considered by some as "LP Model
                    prototypes". However, later 1952 Les Pauls were issued serial numbers and also came with bound
                    fingerboards. The design scheme of some of these early models varied. For instance, some early Les
                    Pauls were fitted with black covered P-90 pickups instead of the usual cream-colored plastic covers.
                    The weight and the tonal characteristics of the Goldtop Les Paul were largely due to the mahogany
                    and maple</p> <br>
                <p>
                    In 1953, the trapeze tailpiece was dropped, and a new stopbar design was added. This design
                    combined a pre-intonated bridge and tailpiece with two studs just behind the bridge pickup. This
                    increased the sustain of the Goldtop noticeably; however, the intonation and string height
                    adjustability were limited. A new design, the Tune-o-matic, replaced the stopbar in 1955. It
                    consisted of a separate bridge and tailpiece attached directly to the top of the guitar, combining
                    an easily adjustable bridge with a sustain-carrying tailpiece. This design has been used on most Les
                    Pauls ever since. The tuners were produced by Kluson. In 1968, Gibson reintroduced the Les Paul
                    Custom as a two-pickup-only model. The headstock angle was changed from 17 degrees to 14, and a
                    wider headstock and a maple top (in lieu of the original 1953â€“1961 mahogany top construction) were
                    added. White and two sunburst finish options were added to the color palette in 1974. Also new in
                    1974 was the optional TP-6 fine-tuner tailpiece, allowing for micro-adjustment of string tuning from
                    the bridge.
